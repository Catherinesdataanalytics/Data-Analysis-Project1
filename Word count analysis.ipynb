      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\r\n",
      "Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\r\n",
      "something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard -\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"- yes, their son, Harry -\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\r\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,\r\n",
      "snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn��t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn��t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He��d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\r\n",
      "sister. He didn��t blame her �� if he��d had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . .\r\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon\r\n",
      "and when he left the building at five o��clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\r\n",
      "was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\r\n",
      "stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\r\n",
      "know... her crowd.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\r\n",
      "agree.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\r\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn��t see how he\r\n",
      "and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on �� he yawned and turned over �� it couldn��t affect them . . .\r\n",
      "How very wrong he was.\r\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but\r\n",
      "the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn��t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.\r\n",
      "In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\r\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no\r\n",
      "reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if\r\n",
      "You-Know-Who has gone -\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it... Oh, Albus...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I know...\" he said heavily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all. They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dumbledore nodded glumly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's -- it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family he has left now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written them a letter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "��Exactly,�� said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. ��It would be enough to turn any boy��s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won��t even remember! Can��t you see how much better off he��ll be, growing up away from all that until he��s ready to take it?��\r\n",
      "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,\r\n",
      "swallowed, and then said, ��Yes �� yes, you��re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?�� She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\r\n",
      "��Hagrid��s bringing him.��\r\n",
      "��You think it �� wise �� to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?��\r\n",
      "��I would trust Hagrid with my life,�� said Dumbledore.\r\n",
      "��I��m not saying his heart isn��t in the right place,�� said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, ��but you can��t pretend he��s not careless.\r\n",
      "He does tend to �� what was that?��\r\n",
      "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It\r\n",
      "grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky �� and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've got him, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No problems, were there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\r\n",
      "before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He'll have that scar forever.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house. \"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you'll wake the Muggles!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that. We've no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\r\n",

He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"\n"

       "'Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\\'d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\\'t hold with such nonsense.\\r\\rMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\r\\rThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\\'t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\\'s sister, but they hadn\\'t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\\'t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\\'t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\\r\\rWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\\r\\rNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\r\\rAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\rDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\\r\\r\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\r\\rIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\rsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\\'t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\r\\rBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\r\\rMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\\'t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\'d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\r\\rHe\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\'t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.\\r\\r\"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard -\"\\r\\r\"- yes, their son, Harry -\"\\r\\rMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\\rHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,\\rsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\\xa1\\xaft such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\\xa1\\xaft even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\\xa1\\xafd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\\rsister. He didn\\xa1\\xaft blame her \\xa1\\xaa if he\\xa1\\xafd had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . .\\rHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon\\rand when he left the building at five o\\xa1\\xafclock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.\\r\\r\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\\rwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\\r\\rAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\r\\rMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\\'t approve of imagination.\\r\\rAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn\\'t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he\\'d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\\r\\r\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\\r\\rThe cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\\r\\rMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:\\r\\r\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"\\r\\r\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it\\'s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\\r\\rMr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...\\r\\rMrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven\\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\\r\\rAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\\'t have a sister.\\r\\r\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\\r\\r\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls... shooting\\rstars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\"\\r\\r\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\\r\\r\"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you\\rknow... her crowd.\"\\r\\rMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son -- he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\"\\r\\r\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\\r\\r\"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\r\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\\r\\r\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite\\ragree.\"\\r\\rHe didn\\'t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\\r\\rWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn\\'t think he could bear it.\\r\\rThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\\rDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn\\xa1\\xaft see how he\\rand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\xa1\\xaa he yawned and turned over \\xa1\\xaa it couldn\\xa1\\xaft affect them . . .\\rHow very wrong he was.\\rMr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but\\rthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\\xa1\\xaft so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead.\\rIn fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\r\\rA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\\'d have thought he\\'d just popped out of the ground. The cat\\'s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\r\\rNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\\'s name was Albus Dumbledore.\\r\\rAlbus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\\r\\rHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\\'t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\'t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.\\r\\r\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\\r\\rHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.\\r\\r\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\\r\\r\"My dear Professor, I \\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\\r\\r\"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\\rProfessor McGonagall.\\r\\r\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\\'\\r\\rProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\r\\r\"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I\\'ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\"\\r\\r\"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\\r\\r\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no\\rreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\\r\\rShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\"\\r\\r\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\\r\\r\"A what?\"\\r\\r\"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of.\"\\r\\r\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if\\rYou-Know-Who has gone -\"\\r\\r\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \\'You- Know-Who\\' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\'You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\\r\\r\"I know you haven \\'t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows you\\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\\r\\r\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\"\\r\\r\"Only because you\\'re too -- well -- noble to use them.\"\\r\\r\"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\"\\r\\rProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone\\'s saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\\r\\rIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\r\\r\"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they\\'re -- dead.\"\\r\\rDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\r\\r\"Lily and James... I can\\'t believe it... I didn\\'t want to believe it... Oh, Albus...\"\\r\\rDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I know...\" he said heavily.\\r\\rProfessor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not all. They\\'re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\'s son, Harry. But -- he couldn\\'t. He couldn\\'t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\\'re saying that when he couldn\\'t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\'s power somehow broke -- and that\\'s why he\\'s gone.\\r\\rDumbledore nodded glumly.\\r\\r\"It\\'s -- it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s done... all the people he\\'s killed... he couldn\\'t kill a little boy? It\\'s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\"\\r\\r\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\\r\\rProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\"\\r\\r\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\"\\r\\r\"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only family he has left now.\"\\r\\r\"You don\\'t mean -- you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore -- you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\'t find two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\"\\r\\r\"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'ve written them a letter.\"\\r\\r\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\"\\r\\r\\xa1\\xb0Exactly,\\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \\xa1\\xb0It would be enough to turn any boy\\xa1\\xafs head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\xa1\\xaft even remember! Can\\xa1\\xaft you see how much better off he\\xa1\\xafll be, growing up away from all that until he\\xa1\\xafs ready to take it?\\xa1\\xb1\\rProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,\\rswallowed, and then said, \\xa1\\xb0Yes \\xa1\\xaa yes, you\\xa1\\xafre right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\\xa1\\xb1 She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.\\r\\xa1\\xb0Hagrid\\xa1\\xafs bringing him.\\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0You think it \\xa1\\xaa wise \\xa1\\xaa to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0I would trust Hagrid with my life,\\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore.\\r\\xa1\\xb0I\\xa1\\xafm not saying his heart isn\\xa1\\xaft in the right place,\\xa1\\xb1 said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \\xa1\\xb0but you can\\xa1\\xaft pretend he\\xa1\\xafs not careless.\\rHe does tend to \\xa1\\xaa what was that?\\xa1\\xb1\\rA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It\\rgrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\xa1\\xaa and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\\r\\rIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.\\r\\r\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\"\\r\\r\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\'ve got him, sir.\"\\r\\r\"No problems, were there?\"\\r\\r\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right\\rbefore the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\"\\r\\rDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.\\r\\r\"Is that where -?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\\r\\r\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\"\\r\\r\"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\\r\\r\"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we\\'d better get this over with.\"\\r\\rDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\' house. \"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.\\r\\r\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"you\\'ll wake the Muggles!\"\\r\\r\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it -- Lily an\\' James dead -- an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\"\\r\\r\"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\r\\r\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\\r\\r\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\'ll be takin\\' Sirius his bike back. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\\r\\rWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.\\r\\r\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\r\\rDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\r\\r\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.\\r\\rA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect\\rastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his\\rblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"'"

       "'Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such nonsense Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley s sister  but they hadn t met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn t have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn t want Dudley mixing with a child like that When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs \\rDursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls  Little tyke   chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four s drive It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\rsomething peculiar    a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn t realize what he had seen    then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn t a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive    no  looking at the sign  cats couldn t read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes    the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt    these people were obviously collecting for something    yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn t  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery He d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn t know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn t see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying  The Potters  that s right  that s what I heard      yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it \\rHe dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office \\rsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking       no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn\\xa1\\xaft such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn\\xa1\\xaft even sure his nephew was called Harry  He\\xa1\\xafd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her\\rsister  He didn\\xa1\\xaft blame her \\xa1\\xaa if he\\xa1\\xafd had a sister like that       but all the same  those people in cloaks      \\rHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon\\rand when he left the building at five o\\xa1\\xafclock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door  Sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It\\rwas a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don t be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day  And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn t approve of imagination As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw    and it didn t improve his mood    was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes  Shoo   said Mr  Dursley loudly The cat didn t move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word   Won t     Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news  And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern   The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted   said the weatherman   I don t know about that  but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they ve had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early    it s not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight  Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He d have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er    Petunia  dear    you haven t heard from your sister lately  have you  As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn t have a sister  No   she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news   Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls    shooting\\rstars    and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today     So   snapped Mrs  Dursley  Well  I just thought    maybe    it was something to do with    you\\rknow    her crowd  Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name  Potter   He decided he didn t dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son    he d be about Dudley s age now  wouldn t he   I suppose so   said Mrs  Dursley stiffly  What s his name again  Howard  isn t it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes   said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite\\ragree  He didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed  While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there  It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did    if it got out that they were related to a pair of    well  he didn t think he could bear it The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr \\rDursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind     He couldn\\xa1\\xaft see how he\\rand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\xa1\\xaa he yawned and turned over \\xa1\\xaa it couldn\\xa1\\xaft affect them      \\rHow very wrong he was \\rMr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but\\rthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn\\xa1\\xaft so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead \\rIn fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground  The cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots  His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man s name was Albus Dumbledore Albus Dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known  He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again    the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn t look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it  Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall  He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled  How did you know it was me   she asked  My dear Professor  I  ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day   said\\rProfessor McGonagall  All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily  Oh yes  everyone s celebrating  all right   she said impatiently   You d think they d be a bit more careful  but no    even the Muggles have noticed something s going on  It was on their news   She jerked her head back at the Dursleys  dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls    shooting stars     Well  they re not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent    I ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can t blame them   said Dumbledore gently   We ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that   said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that s no\\rreason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors  She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn t  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day You Know Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so   said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They re a kind of Muggle sweet I m rather fond of   No  thank you   said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if\\rYou Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this  You  Know Who  nonsense    for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort   Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying  You Know Who   I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort s name  I know you haven  t  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you re different  Everyone knows you re the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me   said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you re too    well    noble to use them   It s lucky it s dark  I haven t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs  Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone s saying  About why he s disappeared  About what finally stopped him  It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer  What they re saying   she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric s Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are    are    that they re    dead  Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped  Lily and James    I can t believe it    I didn t want to believe it    Oh  Albus    Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know    I know     he said heavily Professor McGonagall s voice trembled as she went on   That s not all  They re saying he tried to kill the Potter s son  Harry  But    he couldn t  He couldn t kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they re saying that when he couldn t kill Harry Potter  Voldemort s power somehow broke    and that s why he s gone Dumbledore nodded glumly  It s    it s true   faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he s done    all the people he s killed    he couldn t kill a little boy  It s just astounding    of all the things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess   said Dumbledore   We may never know  Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch  It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid s late  I suppose it was he who told you I d be here  by the way   Yes   said Professor McGonagall   And I don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here  of all places   I ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They re the only family he has left now   You don t mean    you can t mean the people who live here   cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore    you can t  I ve been watching them all day  You couldn t find two people who are less like us  And they ve got this son    I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets  Harry Potter come and live here   It s the best place for him   said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older  I ve written them a letter   A letter   repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He ll be famous    a legend    I wouldn t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future    there will be books written about Harry    every child in our world will know his name  \\xa1\\xb0Exactly \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses  \\xa1\\xb0It would be enough to turn any boy\\xa1\\xafs head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won\\xa1\\xaft even remember  Can\\xa1\\xaft you see how much better off he\\xa1\\xafll be  growing up away from all that until he\\xa1\\xafs ready to take it \\xa1\\xb1\\rProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind \\rswallowed  and then said  \\xa1\\xb0Yes \\xa1\\xaa yes  you\\xa1\\xafre right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore \\xa1\\xb1 She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it \\r\\xa1\\xb0Hagrid\\xa1\\xafs bringing him \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0You think it \\xa1\\xaa wise \\xa1\\xaa to trust Hagrid with something as important as this \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0I would trust Hagrid with my life \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore \\r\\xa1\\xb0I\\xa1\\xafm not saying his heart isn\\xa1\\xaft in the right place \\xa1\\xb1 said Professor McGonagall grudgingly  \\xa1\\xb0but you can\\xa1\\xaft pretend he\\xa1\\xafs not careless \\rHe does tend to \\xa1\\xaa what was that \\xa1\\xb1\\rA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It\\rgrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\xa1\\xaa and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets  Hagrid   said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sir   said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I ve got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir    house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right\\rbefore the Muggles started swarmin  around  He fell asleep as we was flyin  over Bristol  Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning  Is that where     whispered Professor McGonagall  Yes   said Dumbledore   He ll have that scar forever   Couldn t you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn t  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well    give him here  Hagrid    we d better get this over with  Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys  house   Could I    could I say good bye to him  sir   asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog  Shhh   hissed Professor McGonagall   you ll wake the Muggles   S s sorry   sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can t stand it    Lily an  James dead    an  poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it s all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we ll be found   Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry s blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid s shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out  Well   said Dumbledore finally   that s that  We ve no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah   said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I ll be takin  Sirius his bike back  G night  Professor McGonagall    Professor Dumbledore  sir  Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night  I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall   said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four  Good luck  Harry   he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect\\rastonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his\\rblankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours  time by Mrs  Dursley s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley    He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter    the boy who lived  '"

although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley s sister  but they hadn t met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn t have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn t want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls    Little tyke   chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four s drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar    a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn t realize what he had seen    then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn t a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive    no  looking at the sign  cats couldn t read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes    the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt    these people were obviously collecting for something    yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn t  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn t know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn t see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying    The Potters  that s right  that s what I heard        yes  their son  Harry     Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it  He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking       no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn\\xa1\\xaft such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn\\xa1\\xaft even sure his nephew was called Harry  He\\xa1\\xafd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn\\xa1\\xaft blame her \\xa1\\xaa if he\\xa1\\xafd had a sister like that       but all the same  those people in cloaks       He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\\xa1\\xafclock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door    Sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don t be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day    And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn t approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw    and it didn t improve his mood    was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes    Shoo   said Mr  Dursley loudly   The cat didn t move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word   Won t     Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news    And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern   The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim     Well  Ted   said the weatherman   I don t know about that  but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they ve had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early    it s not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight    Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters     Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He d have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er    Petunia  dear    you haven t heard from your sister lately  have you    As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn t have a sister    No   she said sharply   Why     Funny stuff on the news   Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls    shooting stars    and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today       So   snapped Mrs  Dursley    Well  I just thought    maybe    it was something to do with    you know    her crowd    Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name  Potter   He decided he didn t dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son    he d be about Dudley s age now  wouldn t he     I suppose so   said Mrs  Dursley stiffly    What s his name again  Howard  isn t it     Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me     Oh  yes   said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree    He didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed  While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there  It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did    if it got out that they were related to a pair of    well  he didn t think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind     He couldn\\xa1\\xaft see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\xa1\\xaa he yawned and turned over \\xa1\\xaa it couldn\\xa1\\xaft affect them       How very wrong he was  Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn\\xa1\\xaft so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground  The cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots  His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man s name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known    He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again    the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn t look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it    Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall    He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled    How did you know it was me   she asked    My dear Professor  I  ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly     You d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day   said Professor McGonagall    All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here     Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily    Oh yes  everyone s celebrating  all right   she said impatiently   You d think they d be a bit more careful  but no    even the Muggles have noticed something s going on  It was on their news   She jerked her head back at the Dursleys  dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls    shooting stars     Well  they re not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent    I ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense     You can t blame them   said Dumbledore gently   We ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years     I know that   said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that s no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors    She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn t  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day You Know Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore     It certainly seems so   said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop     A what     A lemon drop  They re a kind of Muggle sweet I m rather fond of     No  thank you   said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone      My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this  You  Know Who  nonsense    for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort   Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying  You Know Who   I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort s name    I know you haven  t  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you re different  Everyone knows you re the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of     You flatter me   said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have     Only because you re too    well    noble to use them     It s lucky it s dark  I haven t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs    Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone s saying  About why he s disappeared  About what finally stopped him    It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer    What they re saying   she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric s Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are    are    that they re    dead    Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped    Lily and James    I can t believe it    I didn t want to believe it    Oh  Albus      Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know    I know     he said heavily   Professor McGonagall s voice trembled as she went on   That s not all  They re saying he tried to kill the Potter s son  Harry  But    he couldn t  He couldn t kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they re saying that when he couldn t kill Harry Potter  Voldemort s power somehow broke    and that s why he s gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly    It s    it s true   faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he s done    all the people he s killed    he couldn t kill a little boy  It s just astounding    of all the things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive     We can only guess   said Dumbledore   We may never know    Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch  It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid s late  I suppose it was he who told you I d be here  by the way     Yes   said Professor McGonagall   And I don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here  of all places     I ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They re the only family he has left now     You don t mean    you can t mean the people who live here   cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore    you can t  I ve been watching them all day  You couldn t find two people who are less like us  And they ve got this son    I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets  Harry Potter come and live here     It s the best place for him   said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older  I ve written them a letter     A letter   repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He ll be famous    a legend    I wouldn t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future    there will be books written about Harry    every child in our world will know his name    \\xa1\\xb0Exactly \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses  \\xa1\\xb0It would be enough to turn any boy\\xa1\\xafs head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won\\xa1\\xaft even remember  Can\\xa1\\xaft you see how much better off he\\xa1\\xafll be  growing up away from all that until he\\xa1\\xafs ready to take it \\xa1\\xb1 Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said  \\xa1\\xb0Yes \\xa1\\xaa yes  you\\xa1\\xafre right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore \\xa1\\xb1 She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it  \\xa1\\xb0Hagrid\\xa1\\xafs bringing him \\xa1\\xb1 \\xa1\\xb0You think it \\xa1\\xaa wise \\xa1\\xaa to trust Hagrid with something as important as this \\xa1\\xb1 \\xa1\\xb0I would trust Hagrid with my life \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore  \\xa1\\xb0I\\xa1\\xafm not saying his heart isn\\xa1\\xaft in the right place \\xa1\\xb1 said Professor McGonagall grudgingly  \\xa1\\xb0but you can\\xa1\\xaft pretend he\\xa1\\xafs not careless  He does tend to \\xa1\\xaa what was that \\xa1\\xb1 A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\xa1\\xaa and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets    Hagrid   said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle     Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sir   said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I ve got him  sir     No problems  were there     No  sir    house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin  around  He fell asleep as we was flyin  over Bristol    Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning    Is that where     whispered Professor McGonagall    Yes   said Dumbledore   He ll have that scar forever     Couldn t you do something about it  Dumbledore     Even if I could  I wouldn t  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well    give him here  Hagrid    we d better get this over with    Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys  house   Could I    could I say good bye to him  sir   asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog    Shhh   hissed Professor McGonagall   you ll wake the Muggles     S s sorry   sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can t stand it    Lily an  James dead    an  poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles      Yes  yes  it s all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we ll be found   Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry s blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid s shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out    Well   said Dumbledore finally   that s that  We ve no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations     Yeah   said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I ll be takin  Sirius his bike back  G night  Professor McGonagall    Professor Dumbledore  sir    Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night    I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall   said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four    Good luck  Harry   he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours  time by Mrs  Dursley s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley    He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter    the boy who lived  '"

the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery \\r\\rhe d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s  he eyed them angrily as he passed  he didn t know why  but they made him uneasy  this bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn t see a single collecting tin  it was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying \\r\\r the potters  that s right  that s what i heard   \\r\\r   yes  their son  harry   \\r\\rmr  dursley stopped dead  fear flooded him  he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it \\rhe dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office \\rsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking       no  he was being stupid  potter wasn\\xa1\\xaft such an unusual name  he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry  come to think of it  he wasn\\xa1\\xaft even sure his nephew was called harry  he\\xa1\\xafd never even seen the boy  it might have been harvey  or harold  there was no point in worrying mrs  dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her\\rsister  he didn\\xa1\\xaft blame her \\xa1\\xaa if he\\xa1\\xafd had a sister like that       but all the same  those people in cloaks      \\rhe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon\\rand when he left the building at five o\\xa1\\xafclock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door \\r\\r sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  it\\rwas a few seconds before mr  dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  he didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  on the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   don t be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  rejoice  for you know who has gone at last  even muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day  \\r\\rand the old man hugged mr  dursley around the middle and walked off \\r\\rmr  dursley stood rooted to the spot  he had been hugged by a complete stranger  he also thought he had been called a muggle  whatever that was  he was rattled  he hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn t approve of imagination \\r\\ras he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw    and it didn t improve his mood    was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning  it was now sitting on his garden wall  he was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes \\r\\r shoo   said mr  dursley loudly \\r\\rthe cat didn t move  it just gave him a stern look  was this normal cat behavior  mr  dursley wondered  trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife \\r\\rmrs  dursley had had a nice  normal day  she told him over dinner all about mrs  next door s problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word   won t     mr  dursley tried to act normally  when dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news \\r\\r and finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today  although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern   the newscaster allowed himself a grin   most mysterious  and now  over to jim mcguffin with the weather  going to be any more showers of owls tonight  jim  \\r\\r well  ted   said the weatherman   i don t know about that  but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  viewers as far apart as kent  yorkshire  and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday  they ve had a downpour of shooting stars  perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early    it s not until next week  folks  but i can promise a wet night tonight  \\r\\rmr  dursley sat frozen in his armchair  shooting stars all over britain  owls flying by daylight  mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  and a whisper  a whisper about the potters   \\r\\rmrs  dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  it was no good  he d have to say something to her  he cleared his throat nervously   er    petunia  dear    you haven t heard from your sister lately  have you  \\r\\ras he had expected  mrs  dursley looked shocked and angry  after all  they normally pretended she didn t have a sister \\r\\r no   she said sharply   why  \\r\\r funny stuff on the news   mr  dursley mumbled   owls    shooting\\rstars    and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today    \\r\\r so   snapped mrs  dursley \\r\\r well  i just thought    maybe    it was something to do with    you\\rknow    her crowd  \\r\\rmrs  dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  mr  dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name  potter   he decided he didn t dare  instead he said  as casually as he could   their son    he d be about dudley s age now  wouldn t he  \\r\\r i suppose so   said mrs  dursley stiffly \\r\\r what s his name again  howard  isn t it  \\r\\r harry  nasty  common name  if you ask me  \\r\\r oh  yes   said mr  dursley  his heart sinking horribly   yes  i quite\\ragree  \\r\\rhe didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed  while mrs  dursley was in the bathroom  mr  dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  the cat was still there  it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something \\r\\rwas he imagining things  could all this have anything to do with the potters  if it did    if it got out that they were related to a pair of    well  he didn t think he could bear it \\r\\rthe dursleys got into bed  mrs  dursley fell asleep quickly but mr \\rdursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  his last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs  dursley  the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind     he couldn\\xa1\\xaft see how he\\rand petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\xa1\\xaa he yawned and turned over \\xa1\\xaa it couldn\\xa1\\xaft affect them      \\rhow very wrong he was \\rmr  dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but\\rthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  it was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive  it didn\\xa1\\xaft so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead \\rin fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all \\r\\ra man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground  the cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed \\r\\rnothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive  he was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  he was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots  his blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  this man s name was albus dumbledore \\r\\ralbus dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  he was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  but he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  for some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  he chuckled and muttered   i should have known  \\r\\rhe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  he flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  he clicked it again    the next lamp flickered into darkness  twelve times he clicked the put outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  if anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed mrs  dursley  they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  he didn t look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it \\r\\r fancy seeing you here  professor mcgonagall  \\r\\rhe turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  she  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  she looked distinctly ruffled \\r\\r how did you know it was me   she asked \\r\\r my dear professor  i  ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly  \\r\\r you d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day   said\\rprofessor mcgonagall \\r\\r all day  when you could have been celebrating  i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   \\r\\rprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrily \\r\\r oh yes  everyone s celebrating  all right   she said impatiently   you d think they d be a bit more careful  but no    even the muggles have noticed something s going on  it was on their news   she jerked her head back at the dursleys  dark living room window   i heard it  flocks of owls    shooting stars     well  they re not completely stupid  they were bound to notice something  shooting stars down in kent    i ll bet that was dedalus diggle  he never had much sense  \\r\\r you can t blame them   said dumbledore gently   we ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years  \\r\\r i know that   said professor mcgonagall irritably   but that s no\\rreason to lose our heads  people are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in muggle clothes  swapping rumors  \\r\\rshe threw a sharp  sideways glance at dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn t  so she went on   a fine thing it would be if  on the very day you know who seems to have disappeared at last  the muggles found out about us all  i suppose he really has gone  dumbledore  \\r\\r it certainly seems so   said dumbledore   we have much to be thankful for  would you care for a lemon drop  \\r\\r a what  \\r\\r a lemon drop  they re a kind of muggle sweet i m rather fond of  \\r\\r no  thank you   said professor mcgonagall coldly  as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops   as i say  even if\\ryou know who has gone   \\r\\r my dear professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  all this  you  know who  nonsense    for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  voldemort   professor mcgonagall flinched  but dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   it all gets so confusing if we keep saying  you know who   i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort s name \\r\\r i know you haven  t  said professor mcgonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   but you re different  everyone knows you re the only one you know  oh  all right  voldemort  was frightened of  \\r\\r you flatter me   said dumbledore calmly   voldemort had powers i will never have  \\r\\r only because you re too    well    noble to use them  \\r\\r it s lucky it s dark  i haven t blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs  \\r\\rprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said   the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  you know what everyone s saying  about why he s disappeared  about what finally stopped him  \\r\\rit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  it was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true  dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer \\r\\r what they re saying   she pressed on   is that last night voldemort turned up in godric s hollow  he went to find the potters  the rumor is that lily and james potter are    are    that they re    dead  \\r\\rdumbledore bowed his head  professor mcgonagall gasped \\r\\r lily and james    i can t believe it    i didn t want to believe it    oh  albus    \\r\\rdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   i know    i know     he said heavily \\r\\rprofessor mcgonagall s voice trembled as she went on   that s not all  they re saying he tried to kill the potter s son  harry  but    he couldn t  he couldn t kill that little boy  no one knows why  or how  but they re saying that when he couldn t kill harry potter  voldemort s power somehow broke    and that s why he s gone \\r\\rdumbledore nodded glumly \\r\\r it s    it s true   faltered professor mcgonagall   after all he s done    all the people he s killed    he couldn t kill a little boy  it s just astounding    of all the things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven did harry survive  \\r\\r we can only guess   said dumbledore   we may never know  \\r\\rprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  it was a very odd watch  it had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  it must have made sense to dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   hagrid s late  i suppose it was he who told you i d be here  by the way  \\r\\r yes   said professor mcgonagall   and i don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here  of all places  \\r\\r i ve come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle  they re the only family he has left now  \\r\\r you don t mean    you can t mean the people who live here   cried professor mcgonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   dumbledore    you can t  i ve been watching them all day  you couldn t find two people who are less like us  and they ve got this son    i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets  harry potter come and live here  \\r\\r it s the best place for him   said dumbledore firmly   his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older  i ve written them a letter  \\r\\r a letter   repeated professor mcgonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   really  dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  these people will never understand him  he ll be famous    a legend    i wouldn t be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future    there will be books written about harry    every child in our world will know his name  \\r\\r\\xa1\\xb0exactly \\xa1\\xb1 said dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses  \\xa1\\xb0it would be enough to turn any boy\\xa1\\xafs head  famous before he can walk and talk  famous for something he won\\xa1\\xaft even remember  can\\xa1\\xaft you see how much better off he\\xa1\\xafll be  growing up away from all that until he\\xa1\\xafs ready to take it \\xa1\\xb1\\rprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind \\rswallowed  and then said  \\xa1\\xb0yes \\xa1\\xaa yes  you\\xa1\\xafre right  of course  but how is the boy getting here  dumbledore \\xa1\\xb1 she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it \\r\\xa1\\xb0hagrid\\xa1\\xafs bringing him \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0you think it \\xa1\\xaa wise \\xa1\\xaa to trust hagrid with something as important as this \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0i would trust hagrid with my life \\xa1\\xb1 said dumbledore \\r\\xa1\\xb0i\\xa1\\xafm not saying his heart isn\\xa1\\xaft in the right place \\xa1\\xb1 said professor mcgonagall grudgingly  \\xa1\\xb0but you can\\xa1\\xaft pretend he\\xa1\\xafs not careless \\rhe does tend to \\xa1\\xaa what was that \\xa1\\xb1\\ra low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  it\\rgrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\xa1\\xaa and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them \\r\\rif the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  he looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  in his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets \\r\\r hagrid   said dumbledore  sounding relieved   at last  and where did you get that motorcycle  \\r\\r borrowed it  professor dumbledore  sir   said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   young sirius black lent it to me  i ve got him  sir  \\r\\r no problems  were there  \\r\\r no  sir    house was almost destroyed  but i got him out all right\\rbefore the muggles started swarmin  around  he fell asleep as we was flyin  over bristol  \\r\\rdumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning \\r\\r is that where     whispered professor mcgonagall \\r\\r yes   said dumbledore   he ll have that scar forever  \\r\\r couldn t you do something about it  dumbledore  \\r\\r even if i could  i wouldn t  scars can come in handy  i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground  well    give him here  hagrid    we d better get this over with  \\r\\rdumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys  house   could i    could i say good bye to him  sir   asked hagrid  he bent his great  shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  then  suddenly  hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog \\r\\r shhh   hissed professor mcgonagall   you ll wake the muggles  \\r\\r s s sorry   sobbed hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   but i c c can t stand it    lily an  james dead    an  poor little harry off ter live with muggles   \\r\\r yes  yes  it s all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  hagrid  or we ll be found   professor mcgonagall whispered  patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  he laid harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside harry s blankets  and then came back to the other two  for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  hagrid s shoulders shook  professor mcgonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out \\r\\r well   said dumbledore finally   that s that  we ve no business staying here  we may as well go and join the celebrations  \\r\\r yeah   said hagrid in a very muffled voice   i ll be takin  sirius his bike back  g night  professor mcgonagall    professor dumbledore  sir  \\r\\rwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night \\r\\r i shall see you soon  i expect  professor mcgonagall   said dumbledore  nodding to her  professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply \\r\\rdumbledore turned and walked back down the street  on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer  he clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four \\r\\r good luck  harry   he murmured  he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone \\r\\ra breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect\\rastonishing things to happen  harry potter rolled over inside his\\rblankets without waking up  one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours  time by mrs  dursley s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley    he couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   to harry potter    the boy who lived  '"

       "'Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such nonsense \\r\\rMr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere \\r\\rThe Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would dbecover it  They didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley s sbeter  but they hadn t met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn t have a sbeter  because her sbeter and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleybeh as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  Thbe boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn t want Dudley mixing with a child like that \\r\\rWhen Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out hbe most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into hbe high chair \\r\\rNone of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window \\r\\rAt half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up hbe briefcase  pecked Mrs \\rDursley on the cheek  and tried to kbes Dudley good bye but mbesed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing hbe cereal at the walls \\r\\r Little tyke   chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into hbe car and backed out of number four s drive \\r\\rIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\rsomething peculiar    a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn t realize what he had seen    then he jerked hbe head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn t a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in hbe mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive    no  looking at the sign  cats couldn t read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of hbe mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day \\r\\rBut on the edge of town  drills were driven out of hbe mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes    the getups you saw on young people  He supposed thbe was some stupid new fashion  He drummed hbe fingers on the steering wheel and hbe eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whbepering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that thbe was probably some silly stunt    these people were obviously collecting for something    yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  hbe mind back on drills \\r\\rMr  Dursley always sat with hbe back to the window in hbe office on the ninth floor  If he hadn t  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he d stretch hbe legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery \\r\\rHe d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn t know why  but they made him uneasy  Thbe bunch were whbepering excitedly  too  and he couldn t see a single collecting tin  It was on hbe way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying \\r\\r The Potters  that s right  that s what I heard   \\r\\r   yes  their son  Harry   \\r\\rMr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whbeperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it \\rHe dashed back across the road  hurried up to hbe office \\rsnapped at hbe secretary not to dbeturb him  seized hbe telephone  and had almost finbehed dialing hbe home number when he changed hbe mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked hbe mustache  thinking       no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn\\xa1\\xaft such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn\\xa1\\xaft even sure hbe nephew was called Harry  He\\xa1\\xafd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her\\rsbeter  He didn\\xa1\\xaft blame her \\xa1\\xaa if he\\xa1\\xafd had a sbeter like that       but all the same  those people in cloaks      \\rHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon\\rand when he left the building at five o\\xa1\\xafclock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door \\r\\r Sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It\\rwas a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  hbe face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don t be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  thbe happy  happy day  \\r\\rAnd the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off \\r\\rMr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to hbe car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn t approve of imagination \\r\\rAs he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw    and it didn t improve hbe mood    was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning  It was now sitting on hbe garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes \\r\\r Shoo   said Mr  Dursley loudly \\r\\rThe cat didn t move  It just gave him a stern look  Was thbe normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to hbe wife \\r\\rMrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word   Won t     Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news \\r\\r And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrbee  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern   The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim  \\r\\r Well  Ted   said the weatherman   I don t know about that  but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I prombeed yesterday  they ve had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early    it s not until next week  folks  But I can prombee a wet night tonight  \\r\\rMr  Dursley sat frozen in hbe armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whbeper  a whbeper about the Potters   \\r\\rMrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He d have to say something to her  He cleared hbe throat nervously   Er    Petunia  dear    you haven t heard from your sbeter lately  have you  \\r\\rAs he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn t have a sbeter \\r\\r No   she said sharply   Why  \\r\\r Funny stuff on the news   Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls    shooting\\rstars    and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today    \\r\\r So   snapped Mrs  Dursley \\r\\r Well  I just thought    maybe    it was something to do with    you\\rknow    her crowd  \\r\\rMrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name  Potter   He decided he didn t dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son    he d be about Dudley s age now  wouldn t he  \\r\\r I suppose so   said Mrs  Dursley stiffly \\r\\r What s hbe name again  Howard  ben t it  \\r\\r Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me  \\r\\r Oh  yes   said Mr  Dursley  hbe heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite\\ragree  \\r\\rHe didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed  While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there  It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something \\r\\rWas he imagining things  Could all thbe have anything to do with the Potters  If it did    if it got out that they were related to a pair of    well  he didn t think he could bear it \\r\\rThe Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr \\rDursley lay awake  turning it all over in hbe mind  Hbe last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind     He couldn\\xa1\\xaft see how he\\rand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\xa1\\xaa he yawned and turned over \\xa1\\xaa it couldn\\xa1\\xaft affect them      \\rHow very wrong he was \\rMr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but\\rthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn\\xa1\\xaft so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead \\rIn fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all \\r\\rA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground  The cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed \\r\\rNothing like thbe man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of hbe hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into hbe belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots  Hbe blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and hbe nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  Thbe man s name was Albus Dumbledore \\r\\rAlbus Dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from hbe name to hbe boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in hbe cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known  \\r\\rHe found what he was looking for in hbe inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again    the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the dbetance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside hbe cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn t look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it \\r\\r Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall  \\r\\rHe turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked dbetinctly ruffled \\r\\r How did you know it was me   she asked \\r\\r My dear Professor  I  ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly  \\r\\r You d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day   said\\rProfessor McGonagall \\r\\r All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily \\r\\r Oh yes  everyone s celebrating  all right   she said impatiently   You d think they d be a bit more careful  but no    even the Muggles have noticed something s going on  It was on their news   She jerked her head back at the Dursleys  dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls    shooting stars     Well  they re not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent    I ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense  \\r\\r You can t blame them   said Dumbledore gently   We ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years  \\r\\r I know that   said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that s no\\rreason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors  \\r\\rShe threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn t  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day You Know Who seems to have dbeappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore  \\r\\r It certainly seems so   said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop  \\r\\r A what  \\r\\r A lemon drop  They re a kind of Muggle sweet I m rather fond of  \\r\\r No  thank you   said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn t think thbe was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if\\rYou Know Who has gone   \\r\\r My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by hbe name  All thbe  You  Know Who  nonsense    for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by hbe proper name  Voldemort   Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying  You Know Who   I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort s name \\r\\r I know you haven  t  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you re different  Everyone knows you re the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of  \\r\\r You flatter me   said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have  \\r\\r Only because you re too    well    noble to use them  \\r\\r It s lucky it s dark  I haven t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs  \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone s saying  About why he s dbeappeared  About what finally stopped him  \\r\\rIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to dbecuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer \\r\\r What they re saying   she pressed on   be that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric s Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor be that Lily and James Potter are    are    that they re    dead  \\r\\rDumbledore bowed hbe head  Professor McGonagall gasped \\r\\r Lily and James    I can t believe it    I didn t want to believe it    Oh  Albus    \\r\\rDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know    I know     he said heavily \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall s voice trembled as she went on   That s not all  They re saying he tried to kill the Potter s son  Harry  But    he couldn t  He couldn t kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they re saying that when he couldn t kill Harry Potter  Voldemort s power somehow broke    and that s why he s gone \\r\\rDumbledore nodded glumly \\r\\r It s    it s true   faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he s done    all the people he s killed    he couldn t kill a little boy  It s just astounding    of all the things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive  \\r\\r We can only guess   said Dumbledore   We may never know  \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from hbe pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch  It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in hbe pocket and said   Hagrid s late  I suppose it was he who told you I d be here  by the way  \\r\\r Yes   said Professor McGonagall   And I don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here  of all places  \\r\\r I ve come to bring Harry to hbe aunt and uncle  They re the only family he has left now  \\r\\r You don t mean    you can t mean the people who live here   cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore    you can t  I ve been watching them all day  You couldn t find two people who are less like us  And they ve got thbe son    I saw him kicking hbe mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets  Harry Potter come and live here  \\r\\r It s the best place for him   said Dumbledore firmly   Hbe aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older  I ve written them a letter  \\r\\r A letter   repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all thbe in a letter  These people will never understand him  He ll be famous    a legend    I wouldn t be surprbeed if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future    there will be books written about Harry    every child in our world will know hbe name  \\r\\r\\xa1\\xb0Exactly \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of hbe half moon glasses  \\xa1\\xb0It would be enough to turn any boy\\xa1\\xafs head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won\\xa1\\xaft even remember  Can\\xa1\\xaft you see how much better off he\\xa1\\xafll be  growing up away from all that until he\\xa1\\xafs ready to take it \\xa1\\xb1\\rProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind \\rswallowed  and then said  \\xa1\\xb0Yes \\xa1\\xaa yes  you\\xa1\\xafre right  of course  But how be the boy getting here  Dumbledore \\xa1\\xb1 She eyed hbe cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it \\r\\xa1\\xb0Hagrid\\xa1\\xafs bringing him \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0You think it \\xa1\\xaa wbee \\xa1\\xaa to trust Hagrid with something as important as thbe \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0I would trust Hagrid with my life \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore \\r\\xa1\\xb0I\\xa1\\xafm not saying hbe heart ben\\xa1\\xaft in the right place \\xa1\\xb1 said Professor McGonagall grudgingly  \\xa1\\xb0but you can\\xa1\\xaft pretend he\\xa1\\xafs not careless \\rHe does tend to \\xa1\\xaa what was that \\xa1\\xb1\\rA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It\\rgrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\xa1\\xaa and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them \\r\\rIf the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of hbe face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and hbe feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In hbe vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets \\r\\r Hagrid   said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle  \\r\\r Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sir   said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I ve got him  sir  \\r\\r No problems  were there  \\r\\r No  sir    house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right\\rbefore the Muggles started swarmin  around  He fell asleep as we was flyin  over Brbetol  \\r\\rDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just vbeible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over hbe forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning \\r\\r Is that where     whbepered Professor McGonagall \\r\\r Yes   said Dumbledore   He ll have that scar forever  \\r\\r Couldn t you do something about it  Dumbledore  \\r\\r Even if I could  I wouldn t  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that be a perfect map of the London Underground  Well    give him here  Hagrid    we d better get thbe over with  \\r\\rDumbledore took Harry in hbe arms and turned toward the Dursleys  house   Could I    could I say good bye to him  sir   asked Hagrid  He bent hbe great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whbekery kbes  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog \\r\\r Shhh   hbesed Professor McGonagall   you ll wake the Muggles  \\r\\r S s sorry   sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying hbe face in it   But I c c can t stand it    Lily an  James dead    an  poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles   \\r\\r Yes  yes  it s all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we ll be found   Professor McGonagall whbepered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of hbe cloak  tucked it inside Harry s blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid s shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out \\r\\r Well   said Dumbledore finally   that s that  We ve no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations  \\r\\r Yeah   said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I ll be takin  Sirius hbe bike back  G night  Professor McGonagall    Professor Dumbledore  sir  \\r\\rWiping hbe streaming eyes on hbe jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night \\r\\r I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall   said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply \\r\\rDumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four \\r\\r Good luck  Harry   he murmured  He turned on hbe heel and with a swbeh of hbe cloak  he was gone \\r\\rA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect\\rastonbehing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside hbe\\rblankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours  time by Mrs  Dursley s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by hbe cousin Dudley    He couldn t know that at thbe very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter    the boy who lived  '"

       "'Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn t hold with such nonsense \\r\\rMr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere \\r\\rThe Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley s sister  but they hadn t met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn t have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn t want Dudley mixing with a child like that \\r\\rWhen Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair \\r\\rNone of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window \\r\\rAt half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs \\rDursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls \\r\\r Little tyke   chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four s drive \\r\\rIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\rsomething peculiar    a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn t realize what he had seen    then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn t a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive    no  looking at the sign  cats couldn t read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day \\r\\rBut on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn t bear people who dressed in funny clothes    the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren t young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt    these people were obviously collecting for something    yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills \\r\\rMr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn t  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery \\r\\rHe d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker s  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn t know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn t see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying \\r\\r The Potters  that s right  that s what I heard   \\r\\r   yes  their son  Harry   \\r\\rMr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it \\rHe dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office \\rsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking       no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn\\xa1\\xaft such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn\\xa1\\xaft even sure his nephew was called Harry  He\\xa1\\xafd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her\\rsister  He didn\\xa1\\xaft blame her \\xa1\\xaa if he\\xa1\\xafd had a sister like that       but all the same  those people in cloaks      \\rHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon\\rand when he left the building at five o\\xa1\\xafclock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door \\r\\r Sorry   he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It\\rwas a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don t be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day  \\r\\rAnd the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off \\r\\rMr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn t approve of imagination \\r\\rAs he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw    and it didn t improve his mood    was the tabby cat he d spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes \\r\\r Shoo   said Mr  Dursley loudly \\r\\rThe cat didn t move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife \\r\\rMrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word   Won t     Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news \\r\\r And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation s owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern   The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim  \\r\\r Well  Ted   said the weatherman   I don t know about that  but it s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they ve had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early    it s not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight  \\r\\rMr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   \\r\\rMrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He d have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er    Petunia  dear    you haven t heard from your sister lately  have you  \\r\\rAs he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn t have a sister \\r\\r No   she said sharply   Why  \\r\\r Funny stuff on the news   Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls    shooting\\rstars    and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today    \\r\\r So   snapped Mrs  Dursley \\r\\r Well  I just thought    maybe    it was something to do with    you\\rknow    her crowd  \\r\\rMrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he d heard the name  Potter   He decided he didn t dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son    he d be about Dudley s age now  wouldn t he  \\r\\r I suppose so   said Mrs  Dursley stiffly \\r\\r What s his name again  Howard  isn t it  \\r\\r Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me  \\r\\r Oh  yes   said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite\\ragree  \\r\\rHe didn t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed  While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there  It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something \\r\\rWas he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did    if it got out that they were related to a pair of    well  he didn t think he could bear it \\r\\rThe Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr \\rDursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind     He couldn\\xa1\\xaft see how he\\rand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\xa1\\xaa he yawned and turned over \\xa1\\xaa it couldn\\xa1\\xaft affect them      \\rHow very wrong he was \\rMr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but\\rthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn\\xa1\\xaft so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead \\rIn fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all \\r\\rA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you d have thought he d just popped out of the ground  The cat s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed \\r\\rNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots  His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man s name was Albus Dumbledore \\r\\rAlbus Dumbledore didn t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known  \\r\\rHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again    the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn t look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it \\r\\r Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall  \\r\\rHe turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled \\r\\r How did you know it was me   she asked \\r\\r My dear Professor  I  ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly  \\r\\r You d be stiff if you d been sitting on a brick wall all day   said\\rProfessor McGonagall \\r\\r All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily \\r\\r Oh yes  everyone s celebrating  all right   she said impatiently   You d think they d be a bit more careful  but no    even the Muggles have noticed something s going on  It was on their news   She jerked her head back at the Dursleys  dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls    shooting stars     Well  they re not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent    I ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense  \\r\\r You can t blame them   said Dumbledore gently   We ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years  \\r\\r I know that   said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that s no\\rreason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors  \\r\\rShe threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn t  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day You Know Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore  \\r\\r It certainly seems so   said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop  \\r\\r A what  \\r\\r A lemon drop  They re a kind of Muggle sweet I m rather fond of  \\r\\r No  thank you   said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn t think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if\\rYou Know Who has gone   \\r\\r My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this  You  Know Who  nonsense    for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort   Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying  You Know Who   I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort s name \\r\\r I know you haven  t  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you re different  Everyone knows you re the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of  \\r\\r You flatter me   said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have  \\r\\r Only because you re too    well    noble to use them  \\r\\r It s lucky it s dark  I haven t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs  \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone s saying  About why he s disappeared  About what finally stopped him  \\r\\rIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer \\r\\r What they re saying   she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric s Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are    are    that they re    dead  \\r\\rDumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped \\r\\r Lily and James    I can t believe it    I didn t want to believe it    Oh  Albus    \\r\\rDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know    I know     he said heavily \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall s voice trembled as she went on   That s not all  They re saying he tried to kill the Potter s son  Harry  But    he couldn t  He couldn t kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they re saying that when he couldn t kill Harry Potter  Voldemort s power somehow broke    and that s why he s gone \\r\\rDumbledore nodded glumly \\r\\r It s    it s true   faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he s done    all the people he s killed    he couldn t kill a little boy  It s just astounding    of all the things to stop him    but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive  \\r\\r We can only guess   said Dumbledore   We may never know  \\r\\rProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch  It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid s late  I suppose it was he who told you I d be here  by the way  \\r\\r Yes   said Professor McGonagall   And I don t suppose you re going to tell me why you re here  of all places  \\r\\r I ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They re the only family he has left now  \\r\\r You don t mean    you can t mean the people who live here   cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore    you can t  I ve been watching them all day  You couldn t find two people who are less like us  And they ve got this son    I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets  Harry Potter come and live here  \\r\\r It s the best place for him   said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he s older  I ve written them a letter  \\r\\r A letter   repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He ll be famous    a legend    I wouldn t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future    there will be books written about Harry    every child in our world will know his name  \\r\\r\\xa1\\xb0Exactly \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses  \\xa1\\xb0It would be enough to turn any boy\\xa1\\xafs head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won\\xa1\\xaft even remember  Can\\xa1\\xaft you see how much better off he\\xa1\\xafll be  growing up away from all that until he\\xa1\\xafs ready to take it \\xa1\\xb1\\rProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind \\rswallowed  and then said  \\xa1\\xb0Yes \\xa1\\xaa yes  you\\xa1\\xafre right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore \\xa1\\xb1 She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it \\r\\xa1\\xb0Hagrid\\xa1\\xafs bringing him \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0You think it \\xa1\\xaa wise \\xa1\\xaa to trust Hagrid with something as important as this \\xa1\\xb1\\r\\xa1\\xb0I would trust Hagrid with my life \\xa1\\xb1 said Dumbledore \\r\\xa1\\xb0I\\xa1\\xafm not saying his heart isn\\xa1\\xaft in the right place \\xa1\\xb1 said Professor McGonagall grudgingly  \\xa1\\xb0but you can\\xa1\\xaft pretend he\\xa1\\xafs not careless \\rHe does tend to \\xa1\\xaa what was that \\xa1\\xb1\\rA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It\\rgrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\xa1\\xaa and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them \\r\\rIf the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets \\r\\r Hagrid   said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle  \\r\\r Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sir   said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I ve got him  sir  \\r\\r No problems  were there  \\r\\r No  sir    house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right\\rbefore the Muggles started swarmin  around  He fell asleep as we was flyin  over Bristol  \\r\\rDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning \\r\\r Is that where     whispered Professor McGonagall \\r\\r Yes   said Dumbledore   He ll have that scar forever  \\r\\r Couldn t you do something about it  Dumbledore  \\r\\r Even if I could  I wouldn t  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well    give him here  Hagrid    we d better get this over with  \\r\\rDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys  house   Could I    could I say good bye to him  sir   asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog \\r\\r Shhh   hissed Professor McGonagall   you ll wake the Muggles  \\r\\r S s sorry   sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can t stand it    Lily an  James dead    an  poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles   \\r\\r Yes  yes  it s all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we ll be found   Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry s blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid s shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore s eyes seemed to have gone out \\r\\r Well   said Dumbledore finally   that s that  We ve no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations  \\r\\r Yeah   said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I ll be takin  Sirius his bike back  G night  Professor McGonagall    Professor Dumbledore  sir  \\r\\rWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night \\r\\r I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall   said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply \\r\\rDumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four \\r\\r Good luck  Harry   he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone \\r\\rA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect\\rastonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his\\rblankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours  time by Mrs  Dursley s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley    He couldn t know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter    the boy who lived  '"
