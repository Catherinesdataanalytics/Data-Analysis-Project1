always remember that: count the loop, decide which is the order of N.

* add or delete one more number to an array. O(1)
public void push(int val){
array[n++] = val }；
array[n--] ；
* add/delete/search/change item to any position: O(N): use average time complexity -> O(0+N)/2 = O(N)

* O(logN) such as transfer one number to 2 format, binary search 
* O(NlogN)
* O(N^2) maopaopaixu
* O(N^3) matrix * matrix
* O(2^N) very slow 
* O(N!)
* O(N^N) 8queens problem
