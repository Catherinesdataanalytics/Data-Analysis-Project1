1)float number problem
float a = 2.0f;
float b = 2.00000000f;
System.out.println(Math.abs(a-b) < 0.000001f);
//if this is right we consider them as the same
2) 
//a < = b // a < b
a< b - 0.00001f

Conversion
small datatype and big datatype

int: small + float:big
int: big + short : small

small can be changed automatically,
big should need changed to become small.

float a = 5;
int b = 4 ;
int b = a//this will be wrong
// you need to use
f = (float)a
int a. = b// this is naturally right
*
such as:
float a = 5.7f;
int b = (int)a;
*
float a = 5.0f
or 
float = float(5.0);
//5.0 means double naturally
*
float a = 3/2;
printout will be 1.0
java looks at this as float.
float a = 3/2.0 or 3.0/2
this will print out 1.5
or
float a  = 3/(2 - 0.0f)
