copy value:the inner variable change will not effect the outer variables;swap questions;

what is value? if it can be represent by 0 and 1.
int, double..they are all value type.
this is in different occation with numbers and array.

inner storage is a big big array;
int here is different with the array.
int is in stack,not in storage.
The array is in storage.

length of array is 4 byte.
so the total storage of array is 4+storage total.

int and value, they store in different places.

//overloading fuction:
同构函数
for example: System.out.println(n);
System.out.println(1);
System.out.println('4');
it can printout a lot kinds of variables out, in different types.
it is called: 同构函数
such as : Math.max(...)

copy value: 
So can we write a swap function? 
swap function can never be changed for the simple number.
